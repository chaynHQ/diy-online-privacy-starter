This guide is a project by [CHAYN](http://chayn.co), an open-source project that uses technology to empower women against violence and oppression so they can live happier and healthier lives. CHAYN created a set of privacy guides after several interactions with real-life domestic abuse survivors, reading scores of articles on doxxing of women online, and from our very own experiences as women who use the internet. Technology and the internet opens us up to new worlds and provides us information at the touch of a button, but it can also open us up to security risks.  

This guide focuses on online stalking, and was created with the help of survivors of domestic violence in many countries. We aim to provide the necessary tools and knowledge to minimise the chance of being tracked by the abusive person(s) after having left the abusive environment. However, the guide can be useful to anyone who is being stalked or tracked online by an abuser, regardless of their gender, location or situation.
CHAYN believes in survivor-led design, which means not only do we listen to survivors, they’re part of the production team - they volunteer with us. 

Using existing online privacy guides tailored for women as inspiration and for reference, CHAYN volunteers began building this guide by crowdsourcing content. There was a lot to cover but we were determined to build an exhaustive easy-to-understand guide that could benefit all internet users. After we had a Version 1 ready, we sent it out to security experts as well as survivors of domestic violence, and people who have experienced stalking and other forms of cyber harassment to give us their feedback. We then assessed their comments and added information to the guide, making it as inclusive as possible. 

Then we introduced Securikitty (meooow!) to help make the guide more user friendly, approachable and to help remind readers when to take breaks and encouraging them to stay strong through the process of protecting themselves.

If you found this guide useful, you may be interested in some of [our other resources](http://chayn.co/tools/) that we have produced such as [How To Build Your Own Domestic Violence Case Without A Lawyer](http://chayn.co/how-to-build-your-own-case/) and information about domestic abuse in [Pakistan](http://chaynpakistan.org/), [India](http://chaynindia.com/) and [Italy](http://chaynitalia.org/) Some of these will only be in English but we’re working on more translations.

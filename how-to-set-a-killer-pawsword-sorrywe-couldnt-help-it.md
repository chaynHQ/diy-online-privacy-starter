# How to set a killer pawsword \(sorry..we couldn’t help it\)

Easy steps to fight the most common vulnerability

1. Password protection

o Visit [How Secure Is My Password](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://howsecureismypassword.net/&sa=D&ust=1478912695253000&usg=AFQjCNG6h_l21RRRJ87_PpD9xd97iskszQ) to test the strength of your passwords

o Never recycle\/reuse passwords

o Do not use the same password across multiple sites - Create a new\/different password for every site you sign up to

o Do not let your browser save your passwords

o Think passphrase instead of password

o Use upper\/lower case letters, numbers, symbols - See [Strong Password Generator](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://strongpasswordgenerator.com/&sa=D&ust=1478912695255000&usg=AFQjCNF4CGIYTghgZsbUBy31lDmtVH1zaQ). Password Managers usually have a built-in password generator to create complex passwords

1. Use a password manager

Password Management software stores encrypted versions of your passwords so you can use a unique, secure password for every service without having to remember every password. There are plenty of[ free Password Managers](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://thehackernews.com/2016/07/best-password-manager.html&sa=D&ust=1478912695257000&usg=AFQjCNEzwQHbdkm7Zk1WwJXOwY3cX7chRA) to select from, for example,[ KeePass](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://keepass.info/&sa=D&ust=1478912695258000&usg=AFQjCNF3wJ_kEFawPfCzLq3-pjZp9myKcQ) \(see[ how to setup and use it](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DGyuVLIbmI5U&sa=D&ust=1478912695259000&usg=AFQjCNGSounfixuUqFIACtrszVyjFp337A)\),[ ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lastpass.com/how-it-works/&sa=D&ust=1478912695260000&usg=AFQjCNGW0ar5yPa2BqW8NIXLB7TPMgqjdQ)[LastPass](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lastpass.com/how-it-works/&sa=D&ust=1478912695261000&usg=AFQjCNEijMOHRYcxds9WlmEzx4DNqBbsLQ) and[ ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://padlock.io/&sa=D&ust=1478912695261000&usg=AFQjCNFxcGt2REBcOh1SPvgosGgK2q0-yA)[Padlock](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://padlock.io/&sa=D&ust=1478912695262000&usg=AFQjCNEDyRYzAGRPt4r8i_iH5YFDAwjBdA).

1. How should you change your password?

There have been debates about how often we should be changing our passwords \(link\). It is also recommended that we change your passwords every 3 – 9 months. We recommend that you change your passwords as often as you need in order to feel secure.

1. Two-Factor Authentication \(2FA\)

Two-Factor Authentication \(2FA\) makes it harder for anyone attempting to hack your accounts. Instead of signing into your accounts using one step \(your password\), you enter a second piece of data, a short code sent to you in an email, or text, or generated by an app on your phone. See which sites allow you to enable two-factor authentication [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://twofactorauth.org/&sa=D&ust=1478912695265000&usg=AFQjCNEq8DdKSELZN1Y-M1W1eNR0i_2Amg).

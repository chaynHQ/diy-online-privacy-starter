This guide is a project by [CHAYN](http://chayn.co), an open-source project that uses technology to empower women against violence and oppression so they can live happier and healthier lives.



The aim of this guide is to equip any person not overly familiar with technology to protect themselves against stalking and being tracked by someone that may harm them. This guide will focus on online stalking, but its companion guide focuses on how to deal with physical stalking.



This guide was created with female victims of domestic violence in mind. We aim to provide the reader with the necessary tools and knowledge to minimise the chance of being tracked by the abusive person(s) after having left the abusive environment. However, the guide can be useful to anyone who is being stalked or tracked online by an abuser, regardless of their gender, location or situation.

Thank you so much for collaborating with us. This will make a real difference to thousands of the world’s most vulnerable people.
